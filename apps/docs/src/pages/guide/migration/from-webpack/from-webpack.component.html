<p>
  Until recently, Angular used Webpack to build applications. Based on this,
  some third-party builders emerged to allow users to use a custom Webpack
  configuration when building their Angular applications.<br />
  When Angular switched to Esbuild, this meant that it became difficult for
  applications that used custom Webpack configurations to migrate to the new
  build system. This guide will help you migrate from Angular with Webpack to
  Rspack.<br />
  By migrating to Rspack, you can gain an immediate build performance benefit
  while maintaining the your existing Webpack build toolchain.

<h2>Step 1: Initialize Nx</h2>

<app-callout type="warning" title="Optional Step">
  <p>If you are already using Nx with version <code class="inline-code">{{nxVersionWithGenerator}}</code> or greater, you can skip this step.</p>
</app-callout>

<p>
  Nx provides a generator to convert existing Angular Webpack projects to use
<code class="inline-code">&#64;ng-rspack/build</code>. This generator is
currently available in Nx {{nxVersionWithGenerator}}.
</p>

<p>At the root of your project, run the following command:</p>

<app-code-block language="shell">
  npx nx&#64;{{nxVersionWithGenerator}} init
</app-code-block>
<br />
<app-callout type="info" title="What is Nx?">
  <p>
    Nx is a build system, optimized for monorepos, with plugins for popular
    frameworks and tools and advanced CI capabilities including caching and
    distribution. You can learn more about Nx at
    <a href="https://nx.dev" target="_blank">nx.dev</a>.
  </p>
</app-callout>

<h2>Step 2: Run the Convert to Rspack Generator</h2>

<p>
  With Nx now initialized, the
  <code class="inline-code">&#64;nx/angular</code> plugin will have been
  installed providing access to a series of generators and executors that aid
  Angular development.<br />
  In particular, the
  <code class="inline-code">&#64;nx/angular:convert-to-rspack</code> generator
  will convert an Angular project to use Rspack.<br />
  To use it, run the following command:
</p>

<app-code-block language="shell">
  npx nx g convert-to-rspack
</app-code-block>

<h2>Step 3: Run your application</h2>

<p>
  After running the generator, you can run tasks such as
  <code class="inline-code">build</code> and
  <code class="inline-code">serve</code> to build and serve your application.
</p>

<app-code-block language="shell">
  npx nx build yourProjectName
  npx nx serve yourProjectName
</app-code-block>

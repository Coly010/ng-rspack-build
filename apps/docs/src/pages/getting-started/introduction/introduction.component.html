<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
  Angular's compilation has always been a black box hidden behind layers of
  abstraction and configuration, exposed via the Angular Builders from the
  Angular CLI packages.
</p>
<p>
  Originally, the underlying tool that bundled the Angular application was
  <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a>. This was great as teams were
  able to extend their builds by leveraging the vast Webpack ecosystem and
  plugins that are available.
</p>
<p>
  Over time, it became clear that the inherit slowness with Webpack build speeds
  was becoming more and more of an issue for Angular developers.
</p>
<p>
  The Angular Team decided to address this build speed issue by building out a
  new build pipeline that leveraged
  <a href="https://esbuild.github.io/">Esbuild</a>.
</p>
<p>
  This succeeded in reducing the build times for Angular applications, however,
  it made one crucial mistake. It left the existing Angular applications that
  relied on the Webpack ecosystem behind, with either a difficult migration path
  or none at all.

<h2>Rspack and Rsbuild</h2>

<p>
  The solution to this problem was to create a new build pipeline that would be
  able to leverage the existing Webpack ecosystem and plugins, while also
  providing faster builds for Angular applications.
</p>
<p>
  This is where <a href="https://rspack.dev/">Rspack</a> and
  <a href="https://rsbuild.dev/">Rsbuild</a> come into play.
</p>
<p>
  Rspack is a high performance JavaScript bundler written in Rust. It offers
  strong compatibility with the Webpack ecosystem, allowing for
  <em>almost</em> seamless replacement of webpack, and provides lightning fast
  build speeds.
</p>
<p>
  Because it supports the existing Webpack ecosystem, it provides an answer to
  teams that maintain Angular applications using Webpack and want to migrate to
  a faster build pipeline.
</p>
<p>
  Rsbuild is a build tool based on Rspack, however it does not support the
  Webpack ecosystem. It does provide out-of-the-box (OOTB) Module Federation
  support and a plugin system for extending the build with build speeds
  comparable to Esbuild.
</p>
<p>
  This makes it a great solution for teams that want to migrate to a faster
  build pipeline, but still want the ability to easily extend their builds and
  use <a href="https://module-federation.io/">Module Federation</a>.

    These tools are still in development and have not been fully battle-tested.
    They are also not provided officially by the Angular team, nor the Nx team.
    It is purely a community effort.

# EsLint Report

## General Sorting

### Sort by effort

This sorting order targets developer that plan eslint configuration and used rules.
For them, it is important to understand which rules are questionable to use due to too high effort or rules not fitting the code base.

1. Sort by **type** not fixable- ❌ errors > ⚠️ warnings
2. Sort by **total number** of issues - ❌ errors + ⚠️ warnings count descending
3. Sort **alphabetically** by rule ID ❌ errors + ⚠️ warnings name descending
4. Sort type by **fixable** - ❌🛠 errors > ❌ errors

### Sort by fixable

This sorting order targets developer that actively work on resolving disabled rules
For them, it is important to understand what is the easiest rule to fix.

1. Sort by **type** - ❌ errors > ⚠️ warnings
2. Sort type **errors** by **fixable** - ❌🛠 errors > ❌ errors
3. Sort type **warnings** by **fixable** - ⚠️🛠 warnings > ⚠️ warnings
4. Sort by **total number** of issues - ❌ errors + ⚠️ warnings count descending
5. Sort **alphabetically** by rule ID ❌ errors + ⚠️ warnings name descending

## Inline Report

### Target Audience

Inline reports target developers actively migrating the code base.
It groups between general and tests related rules and there splits into error and warning blocks.

**The rules are [sort by effort](#sort-by-fixable)**

This report helps to **understand what rule to fix next**.

### Example

```ts
const nextEslintConfig = require('./eslint.next.config');

// 🚨 DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE MANUALLY! 🚨
// Run `pnpm eslint-next/nx` to update or remove this file if all rules pass.
// Add new rules globally to the `eslint.config.js` or locally to the `eslint.next.config.js` file.
// For details, refer to: tools/scripts/eslint-next/README.md
module.exports = [
  ...nextEslintConfig,
  {
    files: ['**/*'],
    rules: {
      // ⚠️ Warnings: 3
      '@typescript-eslint/no-non-null-assertion': 'off', // ⚠️ 7 warnings
      '@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars': 'off', // ⚠️ 2 warnings
    },
  },
  {
    files: ['*.spec.ts', '*.test.ts', '**/test/**/*', '**/mock/**/*'],
    rules: {
      // ❌ Errors: 3
      '@typescript-eslint/no-non-null-assertion': 'off', // ❌ 3 errors
      // ⚠️ Warnings: 3
      'no-console': 'off', // ⚠️ 2 warnings
    },
  },
];
```

## Terminal Report

### Target Audience

Terminal reports target developers configuring and migration the code base.
The total count is grouped into fixable and non-fixable rules and there split into error and warning blocks.

**The rules are [sort by effort](#sort-by-effort)**

This report helps to **understand what rule to fix next**.

### Example

```text
ESLint Rule Summary

---

- Fixable Errors: 25
- Fixable Warnings: 15
- Total Errors: 40
- Total Warnings: 22

---

## Rule Details By Effort

- **no-unused-vars**: ❌ 12, ⚠️ 5 🛠️
- **eqeqeq**: ❌ 8, 🛠️
- **no-console**: ⚠️ 6, ️🛠️
- **no-undef**: ❌ 10
- **prefer-const**: ❌ 7, ⚠️ 4
- **import/no-unresolved**: ❌ 8, ⚠️ 1
- **react-hooks/exhaustive-deps**: ⚠️ 1
```

## Md Report

### Target Audience

Terminal reports target developers configuring EsLint and selection rules as well as configuration.
The total count is grouped into fixable and non-fixable rules and there split into error and warning blocks.

**The rules are [sort by effort](#sort-by-effort)**.

This report helps to **understand what rule to use and how to configure**.

In addition to the sorting, the list provides a checked checkbox for each bullet point.
A checked box means we move the rule as in the codebase, unchecked means completely removed or needs discussion/configuration.

This can be copied in a PR to streamline review and discussions.

### Example

```text
# ESLint Rule Summary

- **Fixable Errors:** 25
- **Fixable Warnings:** 15
- **Total Errors:** 40

## Rule Details By Effort

- [x] **no-unused-vars**: ❌ 12, ⚠️ 5 🛠️

- [ ] **no-console**: ⚠️ 6, ️🛠️ - needs exception config for tests
- [x] **no-undef**: ❌ 10
- [ ] **prefer-const**: ❌ 7, ⚠️ 4 - effort too high
